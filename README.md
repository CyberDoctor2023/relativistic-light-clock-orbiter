## 🔭 About The Project

**Relativistic Light Clock Orbiter** is an educational visualization tool designed to demonstrate the counter-intuitive effects of Special Relativity. By simulating a light clock on a moving platform, users can intuitively grasp concepts like time dilation and length contraction.

Built with **Electron**, **React**, and **Three.js**, this application delivers high-performance 3D graphics directly to your desktop.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **⏱️ Interactive Light Clock**: Watch a photon bounce between mirrors. As velocity increases, observe the path lengthen and time slow down relative to a stationary observer.
*   **🛰️ Real-time Orbit Simulation**: Control an orbiter moving at relativistic speeds.
*   **📉 Lorentz Contraction**: Visually witness the orbiter contract in the direction of motion as it approaches the speed of light ($c$).
*   **🎛️ Dynamic Controls**: Adjust the velocity ratio ($\beta = v/c$) and see immediate updates to the Time Dilation Factor ($\gamma$).
*   **🖥️ Cross-Platform Core**: Built on web technologies, packaged for native performance.
